* Bugfix: From time to time now I'm seeing empty commits with a current
  timestamp and an old commit message.  It doesn't hurt much because they
  are empty, but it's still wrong.
* Feature: Cloning from a particular date. (git-cvs clone -d now /cvs/src)
* Feature: Convert .cvsignore to gitignore(5)
* Feature: Take advantage of git diff --{src,dst}-prefix somehow
* Documentation: Write a man page.

* Feature: Handle branches and tags.
* Refactor: Rename cvsgit.meta package.
* Refactor: Rename 'cvsgit' to 'git-cvs' to mimmic the 'git-svn' bridge command,
  or even turn this into a 'CVS post-processor' (cvspps?) that is less attached
  to Git.
