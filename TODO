* Feature: Verify in bare repository.
* Bug: From time to time now I'm seeing empty commits with a current
  timestamp and an old commit message.  It doesn't hurt much because they
  are empty, but it's still wrong.  (Update: There has been at least one
  case where these spurious commits from the past have not been empty.)
* Feature: Cloning from a particular date. (git-cvs clone -D now /cvs/src)
* Feature: Convert .cvsignore to gitignore(5)
* Documentation: Write a man page.

* Feature: Handle branches and tags.
* Refactor: Rename cvsgit.meta package.
* Refactor: Rename 'cvsgit' to 'git-cvs' to mimmic the 'git-svn' bridge command,
  or even turn this into a 'CVS post-processor' (cvspps?) that is less attached
  to Git.
