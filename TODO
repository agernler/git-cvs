* Rename cvsgit.meta package to cvsgit.sql (for a three-letter acronym) :)
* Rename 'cvsgit' to 'git-cvs' to mimmic the 'git-svn' bridge command, or
  even turn this into a 'CVS post-processor' (cvspps?) that is less attached
  to Git.
* Install 'git-cvs' in Git's --exec-path (optional?).
* http://andialbrecht.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/creating-a-man-page-with-distutils-and-optparse/
* Handle branches and tags.

* Feature: Cloning from a particular date. (git-cvs clone -d now /cvs/src)

OPENBSD CONVERSION ISSUES
=========================

* (no known issues at the moment)

MISSING TESTS
=============

* expand $Mdocdate$ macro on commit like this: $Mdocdate: February 6 2009 $,
  for example in src/etc/MAKEDEV.man or src/bin/ps/ps.1
